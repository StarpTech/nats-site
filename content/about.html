<p class="lead">NATS is a family of open source products that are tightly integrated but can be deployed independently. NATS is being deployed globally for thousands of innovative use-cases such as mobile, IoT, microservices and cloud native applications.</p>
<p>The core NATS Server acts as a central nervous system for building distributed applications. There are dozens of clients ranging from Java, .NET, to GO. NATS Streaming extends the platform to provide for real-time streaming &amp; big data use-cases.</p>
<p>NATS was created by Derek Collison, Founder and CEO at Apcera in response to the market need for a simple and high performance messaging solution. NATS is currently deployed in some of the largest cloud platforms, including: VMware, CloudFoundry, Baidu, Siemens, and GE. NATS is available under the MIT Open Source License.</p>

<p>NATS Cloud is a managed service based on NATS, allowing you to instantly connect your resources to NATS messaging and scale without the need to maintain or provision any hardware yourself.</p>
